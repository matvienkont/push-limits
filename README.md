```
This native application for Android was designed to cover up one's need in self-discipline and self-developing. 

Used technologies: pure React Native without supportive CLIs, AsyncStorage for storing data and some libraries.

The app has went through multiple code cleaning processes and was tried to be written in a good manner according to author's not huge skills :)
